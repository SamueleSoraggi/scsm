# Integration and comparison

Here you will work in groups and load the datasets from each personal folder to merge them together (all sixteen datasets! Avoid to load twice the same dataset, chose between it or its copy with the `bis` suffix).

The groups are as during the course. Each group has a comparison between Gifu and HAR1 to perform. We chose two comparisons, so that two groups can back each other up looking at their works and sharing ideas. 

| Name | Group | Comparison |
|---|---|---|
| Andersen, Albert Lund  | 1  | HAR1_Control vs Gifu_Control|
| Bagger, Andreas	  | 1  | HAR1_Control vs Gifu_Control|
| Hansen, Mads Würgler	  | 1 | HAR1_Control vs Gifu_Control|
| Milo, Lasse	  | 1  | HAR1_Control vs Gifu_Control|
| Reimick, Sebastian Haunstrup  | 1  | HAR1_Control vs Gifu_Control|
| Hemmingsen, Jonas Klejs  | 2  | HAR1_Infected vs Gifu_Infected|
| Skovmøller, Emma Hvitfeldt  | 2  | HAR1_Infected vs Gifu_Infected|
| Sørensen, Emma Frasez  | 2  |HAR1_Infected vs Gifu_Infected|
|Agersnap, Simon Nørregaard | 2 |HAR1_Infected vs Gifu_Infected|
| Schmidt, Alina | 3 | HAR1_Control vs Gifu_Control|
|Henriksen, Frederik Oskar | 3  | HAR1_Control vs Gifu_Control|
|Lundby, Josephine Marie | 3 | HAR1_Control vs Gifu_Control|
|Nørholm, Anne | 3 | HAR1_Control vs Gifu_Control|

## Instructions

Here you will work together and only one person needs to start `jupyterlab` ( it can be a different person every time ).

1. Start a `jupyterlab` session as you did in [the tutorial session](./tutorial.md)

2. Go into the correct Group folder found inside `426401/Groups_analysis`. Here you find the notebook `integration.ipynb`, a copy from the second part of the tutorial. 
   
3. Try to do the clustering integrating all datasets and then perform the assigned comparison.
