# Single cell data analysis
**Single cell data analysis from the single cell single molecule course at AU**

## Objective of the analysis

* learn to filtered the data and decide filtering thresholds
* integrate datasets across different conditions and consider technical covariates that need to be removed
* compare Gifu against HAR1 mutant in the Control and Infected scenarios, with focus on the HAR1 gene.

## How to proceed

Use the top menu to get instructions for the various parts of the analysis:

1. **Tutorial:** analysis tutorial using data from the [Biorxiv paper of week 6](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.23.521739v1) 
(every student works independently). Tutorial days: 1st wednesday -  1st thursday

2. **Data Filtering:** filtering of your own data (every student works independently). Filtering days: 1st thursday - 1st monday

3. **Data Integration:** integration of all datasets and comparison between between Gifu and HAR1 mutant. Integration days: 1st monday - last wednesday

## Progress discussion

Thursday (May 4th) each group shows the progress made in the integration analysis. You don't need to do slides, just show some main plots/tables from your analysis notebook. 

It is mostly a time to compare progresses and discuss any issue (technically or biologically related).

## Beyond lesson time

Please try to mail if you run into problems (`samuele at birc.au.dk`) so we can try to organize a meeting or zoom session to continue working.
