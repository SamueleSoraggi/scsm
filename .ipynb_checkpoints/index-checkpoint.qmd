:::{.callout-note title="Objective of the analysis"}

* learn to filtered the data and decide filtering thresholds
* interpret data projections
* discuss various clustering and cell identity techniques
* integrate datasets across different conditions
* perform differential gene expression and conserved gene inference
* understand and discuss the results from the workflow for gene coexpression modules

## How to proceed

Use the top menu to get instructions for the various parts of the analysis as you will be noticed during the course. The top menu contains:

1. **Tutorial:** analysis tutorial using data from the [Biorxiv paper of week 6](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.23.521739v1) 
(every student works independently). Tutorial days: 1st and eventually 2nd day of data analysis

2. **Data Filtering:** filtering of your own data (every student works independently). Filtering days: 

3. **Data Integration:** integration of all datasets and comparison between between Gifu and HAR1 mutant. Integration days: 

## Progress discussion

***day (May ***) each group shows the progress made in the integration analysis. You don't need to do slides, just show some main plots/tables from your analysis notebook. Even just one or two plots or tables would be fine.

It is mostly a time to compare progresses and discuss any issue (technically or biologically related).

## Beyond lesson time

Please try to mail if you run into problems (`samuele at birc.au.dk`) so we can try to organize a meeting or zoom session to continue working.
